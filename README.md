# Olist-E-commerce-Data-Warehouse-Architecture
This project demonstrates the end-to-end transformation of a highly fragmented e-commerce dataset into a high-performance analytical environment. I designed and built a transition from a Transactional (OLTP) staging area to an Analytical (OLAP) Star Schema, culminating in an interactive Streamlit dashboard for business intelligence.
